# Umbrella Access News repo

## 0. Repo layout

### 0.0 `./meta`

Out of date project descriptions, and an annotated recorder experiment.

### 0.1 `./phone_service`

FreeSWITCH-powered phone service for legacy access (as Access News was a call-only system originally), and for people for whom using the phone is still the best (and/or most convenient) option.

### 0.2 `./web_service`

Both back- and front-end in one repo at the moment, but this may change.
